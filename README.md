# Command line pomodoro timer
A simple Pomodoro timer implementation in bash with an additional simple timer option. 
This timer can be used to structure work and rest intervals during the day.

To launch the timer you can simply run the `./pom_timer.sh` command.
You can change the bell sound and pomodoro interval times in the settings (option 3).
For help and an explanation of the pomodoro technique visit the documentation (option 4).

The aim of this project was to practice in bash. If you find issues in the code or have better a solution, feel free to let me know.
